## CORS Handling

The extension handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues by proxying API requests through the background script. This setup works because:

1. Chrome extension background scripts have permission to make cross-origin requests if the URL is included in the `host_permissions` in `manifest.json`
2. Content scripts and the sidepanel are subject to CORS restrictions
3. The tools are designed to automatically detect the current environment and:
   - Make direct API calls when running in the background script or Node.js
   - Proxy requests via the background script when running in a content script or sidepanel

If you encounter CORS issues:
- Check that `https://context7.com/*` is included in the `host_permissions` in `manifest.json`
- Verify that the background script is properly handling the message types
- Check the background script console for detailed error messages
