### Option 3: Install from Source

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Build the extension with `npm run build`
4. Load the unpacked extension from the `dist` directory in Chrome

## Configuration

After installation, you'll need to configure your AI provider:

1. Click the Earth Agent extension icon in Chrome
2. Go to Settings
3. Choose your AI provider:
   - **OpenAI**: Add your OpenAI API key (supports GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-o3, etc.)
   - **Anthropic**: Add your Anthropic API key (supports Claude models)
   - **Google**: Add your Google API key (supports Gemini models)
   - **Qwen**: Add your DashScope API key (supports Qwen models)
   - **Ollama**: Configure local Ollama server (requires local installation)
4. Select your preferred model
5. Start chatting with Earth Engine!

### Ollama Setup (Local AI Models)

For Ollama local models:

1. [Install Ollama](https://ollama.com/) on your machine
2. Pull your desired models: `ollama pull gemma3` or `ollama pull llama3`
3. **Important**: Start Ollama with CORS enabled: `OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*" ollama serve`
4. In the extension settings, select "Ollama" as provider
5. Enter your model name (e.g., "gemma3:1b", "llama3:latest")
6. **Tool Support**: Not all models support tools - check [Ollama model search](https://ollama.com/search) for models with "tools" tag for full Earth Engine integration

## Environment Management

The agent includes powerful environment management capabilities:

- **Reset Map/Inspector/Console**: Ask the agent to "reset the map" or "clear the console" to clean up your Google Earth Engine workspace
- **Clear Script**: Request "clear the code" or "start fresh" to remove all code from the Earth Engine editor
- **Natural Language Control**: Simply describe what you want to clean up, and the agent will handle it automatically

These tools help maintain a clean workspace during development and are particularly useful when switching between different Earth Engine tasks.

## AI Model Tool Support

The extension provides powerful Earth Engine integration tools, but tool support varies by AI provider and model:

- **‚úÖ Full Tool Support**: OpenAI GPT models, Anthropic Claude models, Google Gemini models, Qwen models
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Variable Tool Support**: Ollama models - tool support depends on the specific model
  - **Tool-Compatible Ollama Models**: Check [Ollama model search](https://ollama.com/search) for models with "tools" tag
  - **Examples with tools**: `qwen3`, `llama3.1`, `mistral`, `codellama`, `firefunction-v2`
  - **Basic Chat Only**: Models without tool support can still provide Earth Engine guidance and code suggestions
- **üìñ Documentation**: For other providers, refer to their respective documentation for tool/function calling capabilities

**Tip**: For the best Earth Engine integration experience with automated code execution, use tool-compatible models from any provider.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### **üîß Extension Not Working**
- **Refresh the Earth Engine tab** and try again
- **Check your API keys** in the extension settings
- **Verify internet connection** for cloud-based providers
- **For Ollama**: Ensure it's running with `OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*" ollama serve`

#### **üö´ Tools Not Working**
- **Check model compatibility**: Ensure your selected model supports tools
- **For Ollama**: Use models with "tools" tag from [Ollama search](https://ollama.com/search)
- **Try a different provider**: Switch to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or Qwen for guaranteed tool support

#### **‚ö° Performance Issues**
- **Use more specific prompts** to reduce processing time
- **Break complex tasks** into smaller steps
- **Check Earth Engine quotas** if operations fail
- **For local models**: Ensure sufficient system resources

#### **üêõ Code Errors**
- **Ask the agent to debug**: "This code has an error, please fix it"
- **Check console output**: "What errors are showing in the console?"
- **Reset workspace**: "Clear everything and start fresh"

#### **üì° Connectivity Issues**
- **Verify API keys** are correctly entered
- **Check provider status** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Qwen status pages)
- **For Ollama**: Confirm local server is accessible at `http://localhost:11434`

### Getting Help

1. **Use the agent itself**: Ask "How do I..." or "Help me troubleshoot..."
2. **Check the console**: Look for error messages in browser developer tools
3. **Try different models**: Some models may work better for specific tasks
4. **Reset your workspace**: Use environment management tools to start fresh

## Privacy and Security

### Data Handling
- **API Keys**: Stored securely in Chrome extension storage, never shared
- **Chat History**: Kept locally in your browser, not sent to external servers
- **Code and Data**: Only shared with your selected AI provider during active conversations
- **Screenshots**: Stored locally or in your chosen location (Downloads, Google Drive)

### Best Practices
- **Keep API keys secure**: Don't share your extension settings or API keys
- **Review generated code**: Always review code before running important analyses
- **Use appropriate models**: Choose models based on your data sensitivity requirements
- **Regular updates**: Keep the extension updated for latest security features

## Creating a New Release

For developers who want to create releases:

```bash
# Create and push a version tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

# GitHub Actions will automatically:
# - Build the extension
# - Run tests
# - Create a release with installation files
```

## Development

You need nodejs and npm,

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Build the extension with `npm run build`
4. Load the unpacked extension from the `dist` directory in Chrome
5. Create branches and make changes
6. Build the project and refresh the chrome extension to see updates
7. push changes if all works good


## CORS Handling

The extension handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues by proxying API requests through the background script. This setup works because:

1. Chrome extension background scripts have permission to make cross-origin requests if the URL is included in the `host_permissions` in `manifest.json`
2. Content scripts and the sidepanel are subject to CORS restrictions
3. The tools are designed to automatically detect the current environment and:
   - Make direct API calls when running in the background script or Node.js
   - Proxy requests via the background script when running in a content script or sidepanel

If you encounter CORS issues:
- Check that `https://context7.com/*` is included in the `host_permissions` in `manifest.json`
- Verify that the background script is properly handling the message types
- Check the background script console for detailed error messages
