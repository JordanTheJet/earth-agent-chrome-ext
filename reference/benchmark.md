## Methods
There are two ways to run the benchmark:

1. use the playwright to control the browser and extension
2. have a separate panel like the tool test panel. Allow to input the prompts by batch or upload a csv file and then run the benchmark and allow to download the results as a csv file.



The second one would be easier to implement.

## Prompts 

I just want to test when use input prompts and what's the agent reply in batches. Maybe I can build the test by not using playwirght. Instead, use the chrome extension itself. Maybe build a separate panel like the tool test panel. Allow to input the prompts by batch in text input box or upload a csv file and then run the benchmark and allow to download the results as a csv file.
