use mastra for server side for working with ai sdk.
use ai sdk for client side only for the demo and grow. cause we need remember user's data so it make sense that we have momory and all the agents in server side maybe.

If we use server side, then langchain and mastra could be used.

But first try AI SDK to see how far it can goes.
