# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Code Generation Tool
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a tool to convert natural language descriptions into executable GEE JavaScript code.
# Details:
Implement code generation capabilities with: 1) Enhanced prompting for GEE-specific code generation, 2) Integration with the LLM to translate natural language to GEE JavaScript, 3) Code formatting and syntax validation, 4) Action buttons in the UI for code insertion and execution approval, 5) Templates and patterns for common GEE operations, 6) Context-aware code generation based on conversation history.

# Test Strategy:
Test code generation with various natural language requests and verify the generated code is syntactically correct and follows GEE patterns. Validate the code insertion and execution workflow with user approval steps.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design GEE-specific prompting templates [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create specialized prompt templates that guide the LLM to generate valid GEE JavaScript code from natural language descriptions.
### Details:
Develop a set of prompt engineering templates specifically designed for GEE code generation. Include context prefixes that explain GEE concepts, syntax requirements, and common patterns. Create different template variations for various GEE operations (image loading, filtering, visualization, etc.). Document the prompt structure with placeholders for user input and system context. Test prompts with sample inputs to verify they produce valid GEE code structures.

## 2. Implement LLM integration for code translation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Build the core functionality to send natural language requests to the LLM and receive GEE JavaScript code responses.
### Details:
Create an API service that connects to the LLM. Implement functions to construct prompts using templates from subtask 1, combining user input with appropriate context. Handle API responses, extract generated code, and implement error handling for failed requests. Add logging for prompt-response pairs to enable future improvements. Include rate limiting and retry logic for API stability. Test with various natural language inputs to verify code generation quality.

## 3. Build code validation and formatting system [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Create a system to validate generated code against GEE syntax rules and format it according to best practices.
### Details:
Implement a validation module that checks generated code for GEE-specific syntax errors. Create a code formatter that applies consistent styling to generated code. Add detection for common GEE errors like missing Earth Engine initialization, invalid band names, or incorrect method calls. Implement a feedback loop where validation errors can trigger regeneration with more specific prompts. Include helpful error messages that explain validation failures to users. Test with intentionally malformed code to verify error detection.

## 4. Develop UI components for code interaction [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Create UI elements that allow users to view, edit, insert, and execute generated code.
### Details:
Design and implement a code preview component with syntax highlighting for GEE JavaScript. Add action buttons for 'Insert Code', 'Execute Code', 'Regenerate', and 'Edit'. Create a confirmation dialog for code execution to prevent accidental runs. Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions. Add visual indicators for code validation status. Ensure the UI is responsive and accessible. Test the components with various screen sizes and assistive technologies.

## 5. Implement GEE operation templates and patterns library [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Create a library of common GEE code patterns and templates that can be used to improve code generation quality.
### Details:
Compile a comprehensive library of GEE code patterns for common operations (filtering collections, applying algorithms, visualization, exporting, etc.). Structure templates with placeholders for dynamic values. Add metadata to templates including description, use cases, and required parameters. Implement a system to match user requests with appropriate templates. Create a mechanism to combine multiple templates for complex operations. Test template matching with various natural language descriptions to verify appropriate template selection.

## 6. Implement context-aware code generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.4, 6.5
### Description: Enhance the code generation system to consider conversation history and previously generated code.
### Details:
Develop a context management system that tracks conversation history and previously generated code. Implement logic to extract relevant context from prior interactions. Create mechanisms to reference existing variables, functions, and objects in new code generation. Add detection for potential conflicts between existing and new code. Implement smart merging of new code with existing codebase. Add user controls to specify how much context to include. Test with multi-turn conversations to verify context is properly maintained across interactions.
