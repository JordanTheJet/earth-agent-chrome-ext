# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up Chrome Extension Framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the basic structure for the Chrome extension including manifest.json, background script, content scripts, and side panel UI.
# Details:
Create a Manifest V3 compliant extension with the following components: 1) manifest.json with appropriate permissions for the GEE domain (https://code.earthengine.google.com/), 2) Background script for lifecycle management and message passing, 3) Content scripts for DOM interaction with the GEE code editor, 4) Side panel UI with basic HTML/CSS structure. Ensure proper permission scoping to GEE domain only and implement a basic content security policy.

# Test Strategy:
Load the extension in developer mode and verify it appears in the Chrome extensions list. Test that the side panel opens correctly on the GEE website and basic message passing works between components.
