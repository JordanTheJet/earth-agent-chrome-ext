# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop GEE Code Editor Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create content scripts to interact with the GEE code editor DOM for code insertion and execution.
# Details:
Implement GEE editor integration with: 1) Content script to detect and interact with the ACE editor in GEE, 2) Functions to insert generated code into the editor at cursor position, 3) Methods to trigger the run button programmatically, 4) DOM selectors with fallback mechanisms to handle potential GEE UI changes, 5) Basic error handling for DOM interaction failures.

# Test Strategy:
Test code insertion by manually triggering insertion functions and verifying code appears in the editor. Test run button interaction by programmatically triggering execution and verifying the code runs. Validate fallback mechanisms by simulating selector failures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create content script structure and ACE editor detection [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the basic content script structure that can detect when the Google Earth Engine Code Editor is loaded and identify the ACE editor instance on the page.
### Details:
Create a content script that: 1) Runs on the GEE Code Editor page (match pattern: 'https://code.earthengine.google.com/*'), 2) Implements a detection mechanism using MutationObserver to identify when the ACE editor is fully loaded, 3) Creates a reference to the ACE editor instance using appropriate DOM selectors, 4) Implements a polling fallback mechanism if direct detection fails, 5) Adds basic logging for debugging purposes.

## 2. Implement cursor position detection and code insertion [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop functions to detect the current cursor position in the ACE editor and insert generated code at that position.
### Details:
Building on the ACE editor reference: 1) Create a function to get the current cursor position using ACE editor API, 2) Implement a code insertion function that can insert text at the cursor position while preserving formatting, 3) Add support for handling different cursor states (selection vs. single cursor), 4) Implement proper indentation matching for inserted code, 5) Add error handling for cases where cursor position cannot be determined.

## 3. Develop run button interaction [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create methods to programmatically trigger the GEE Code Editor's run button to execute inserted code.
### Details:
Implement functionality to: 1) Identify the run button in the GEE interface using robust DOM selectors, 2) Create a function to programmatically click the run button, 3) Add verification that the click was successful by monitoring for execution indicators, 4) Implement a fallback mechanism using JavaScript execution events if direct clicking fails, 5) Add appropriate delays/checks to ensure the editor is in a ready state before attempting execution.

## 4. Create robust DOM selectors with fallback mechanisms [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Develop a system of DOM selectors with multiple fallback options to handle potential GEE UI changes.
### Details:
Enhance the existing implementation with: 1) A selector strategy pattern that tries multiple selector approaches (ID, class, attribute, xpath), 2) A configuration system to store and update selectors without code changes, 3) Automatic detection of selector failures with fallback to alternative selectors, 4) Logging of selector successes/failures to help with maintenance, 5) A mechanism to notify users when all selectors fail, suggesting a potential UI change that requires extension update.

## 5. Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Add robust error handling for all DOM interactions with appropriate user feedback mechanisms.
### Details:
Complete the integration with: 1) Try-catch blocks around all DOM interactions with specific error messages, 2) User-friendly notifications for different types of failures (editor not found, insertion failed, run failed), 3) A recovery mechanism that attempts to re-establish editor connection if lost, 4) Console logging for debugging that can be enabled/disabled, 5) Integration with the extension's main error reporting system to track issues with the GEE editor integration.
