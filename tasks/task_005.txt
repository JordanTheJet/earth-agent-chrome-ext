# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Dataset Catalog Search Tool using Context7 APIs
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a tool to search and query the GEE dataset catalog using Context7 APIs to find relevant Earth observation data.
# Details:
Develop the dataset search tool with: 1) Integration with Context7 APIs for accessing GEE dataset catalog, 2) Search parameters and results data structures, 3) Methods to query datasets based on user requirements, 4) Display of dataset metadata and usage examples, 5) Tool integration with the LLM agent framework to process natural language queries about datasets, 6) Formatting of search results for display in the chat interface, 7) Separate implementation files from existing codebase, 8) Comprehensive testing with logging for tracking test results.

# Test Strategy:
Test dataset search with various queries and verify relevant results are returned. Validate metadata display for accuracy. Test integration with the agent by asking natural language questions about available datasets. Implement separate test files with detailed logging to track test execution and results.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Context7 API Client for Dataset Catalog [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a client module to interface with Context7 APIs for accessing the GEE dataset catalog
### Details:
Implement a TypeScript client that connects to Context7 APIs. This should include: 1) Authentication handling for API access, 2) Basic API request methods for dataset retrieval using endpoints like 'https://context7.com/api/v1/search?query=%22data%22', 3) Error handling for API failures, 4) Rate limiting compliance, 5) Response parsing to convert API responses into usable TypeScript objects. Create wrapper methods specific to catalog search operations. Implement in separate files from existing codebase with appropriate logging for debugging and testing.

## 2. Design Dataset Search Parameters and Result Models [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Define data structures for search parameters and results compatible with Context7 API
### Details:
Create TypeScript interfaces/classes to represent: 1) Search parameters including dataset type, temporal coverage, spatial coverage, resolution, keywords, and data provider, 2) Dataset metadata results including ID, name, description, bands, resolution, update frequency, and example usage, 3) Pagination and result filtering options. Implement proper validation for search parameters and ensure the result models can be easily serialized to JSON for the frontend. Use TypeScript's type system for type safety and validation. Design models to work specifically with Context7 API response formats.

## 3. Implement Dataset Search Query Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Build the core search functionality to query datasets based on parameters using Context7 APIs
### Details:
Develop the search engine that: 1) Takes search parameter objects and converts them to Context7 API queries, 2) Executes searches against endpoints like 'https://context7.com/api/v1/search?query=%22data%22', 3) Supports topic-based searches using endpoints like 'https://context7.com/api/v1/wybert/earthengine-dataset-catalog-md?topic=population', 4) Processes and filters results based on relevance, 5) Handles pagination for large result sets, 6) Implements sorting options (by relevance, recency, popularity), 7) Provides methods for retrieving detailed metadata for specific datasets. Include optimization for common queries and caching mechanisms for frequently accessed datasets. Implement comprehensive logging for tracking query execution and performance.

## 4. Create Dataset Metadata Formatter [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Develop utilities to format and enrich dataset metadata from Context7 API responses for display
### Details:
Implement a formatter module that: 1) Enriches raw Context7 API dataset metadata with additional useful information, 2) Generates code snippets showing how to use each dataset in GEE, 3) Creates human-readable descriptions of technical metadata, 4) Formats band information in a structured way, 5) Generates preview links or thumbnails where available, 6) Structures metadata in a consistent format regardless of dataset type. Include methods to customize the level of detail in the formatted output based on context. Implement in separate TypeScript files from existing codebase.

## 5. Integrate Natural Language Query Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Connect the search tool with the LLM agent to handle natural language dataset queries using Context7 APIs
### Details:
Develop the integration layer that: 1) Extracts search parameters from natural language queries using the LLM, 2) Converts LLM-extracted parameters into structured search parameter objects for Context7 APIs, 3) Executes searches and retrieves results, 4) Handles follow-up questions about datasets, 5) Manages conversation context to refine searches iteratively. Implement prompt templates for the LLM that guide it to extract relevant search parameters from user queries and create a feedback mechanism to improve parameter extraction over time.

## 6. Implement Chat Interface Result Formatting [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4, 5.5
### Description: Create display formatters for presenting Context7 API search results in the chat interface
### Details:
Build the presentation layer that: 1) Converts Context7 API search results into formatted messages for the chat interface, 2) Creates concise summaries for result listings, 3) Generates detailed views for individual datasets, 4) Implements pagination controls for browsing multiple results, 5) Formats code examples in syntax-highlighted blocks, 6) Provides interactive elements like 'show more details' or 'see usage example' options. Ensure the formatting is responsive to different chat interfaces and includes both text and rich media elements where appropriate.

## 7. Implement Comprehensive Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Create a dedicated testing framework for the Context7 API integration
### Details:
Develop a comprehensive testing framework that: 1) Tests all aspects of the Context7 API integration, 2) Includes unit tests for individual components, 3) Implements integration tests for the complete search workflow, 4) Creates mock responses for testing without hitting the actual API, 5) Implements detailed logging to track test execution and results, 6) Tests different query types including keyword searches and topic-based searches, 7) Validates result formatting and display. Store tests in separate TypeScript files from the implementation code and ensure they can be run independently.

## 8. Implement Logging System for Tracking and Debugging [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.3, 5.7
### Description: Create a robust logging system for tracking Context7 API interactions and debugging issues
### Details:
Develop a logging system that: 1) Tracks all interactions with Context7 APIs, 2) Logs query parameters and response metadata, 3) Implements different log levels for development and production, 4) Creates structured log entries that can be easily analyzed, 5) Includes performance metrics for API calls, 6) Logs errors and exceptions with detailed context, 7) Supports configuration to adjust verbosity. Ensure logs are stored in a way that facilitates troubleshooting and performance optimization.
