# Task ID: 3
# Title: Integrate LLM API Connection
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the connection to user-provided LLM APIs and implement basic prompt handling for GEE questions.
# Details:
Implement LLM integration with: 1) Settings panel for API key configuration and storage, 2) Secure API key storage using Chrome Storage API, 3) Basic prompt engineering for GEE-specific questions, 4) API connection handling with appropriate error management, 5) Integration with Vercel AI SDK for agent development, 6) Simple streaming response display in the chat interface.

# Test Strategy:
Test API connection by sending test prompts and verifying responses. Validate secure storage of API keys. Test error handling with invalid keys or connection issues. Verify streaming responses display correctly in the chat UI.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create settings panel for API configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a user interface for configuring LLM API settings including API key input, model selection, and connection preferences
### Details:
Create a settings panel component with: 1) Input field for API key with appropriate masking, 2) Dropdown for selecting LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), 3) Model selection options based on provider, 4) Temperature and other parameter controls, 5) Test connection button to verify API key validity, 6) Save button to store configuration. Use React components with proper form validation and user feedback.

## 2. Implement secure API key storage [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Set up secure storage for API keys and configuration using Chrome Storage API with appropriate encryption
### Details:
Implement a storage service that: 1) Encrypts API keys before storage using Chrome's chrome.storage.local API, 2) Creates utility functions for saving/retrieving API configuration, 3) Handles validation of stored credentials, 4) Implements proper error handling for storage failures, 5) Provides methods to clear/reset stored credentials, 6) Ensures API keys are never exposed in plaintext in the application state. Use the chrome.storage API with appropriate security practices.

## 3. Develop prompt engineering for GEE questions [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a prompt engineering system specifically designed for Google Earth Engine related questions and queries
### Details:
Build a prompt engineering module that: 1) Creates templates for different types of GEE questions (code help, conceptual questions, error debugging), 2) Implements context injection for GEE-specific terminology and concepts, 3) Formats user questions with appropriate system prompts, 4) Handles prompt length limitations based on model constraints, 5) Includes relevant GEE documentation references in prompts when appropriate. Create a flexible prompt template system that can be easily modified as requirements evolve.

## 4. Implement API connection and error handling [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Create the core API connection service with comprehensive error handling for different failure scenarios
### Details:
Develop an API service that: 1) Establishes connections to various LLM providers based on stored configuration, 2) Implements proper request formatting for each supported provider, 3) Handles authentication errors with user-friendly messages, 4) Manages rate limiting and quota exceeded scenarios, 5) Implements exponential backoff for retries, 6) Provides detailed error information for debugging, 7) Integrates with Vercel AI SDK for standardized API interactions. Use modern JavaScript async/await patterns with proper error boundaries.

## 5. Create streaming response display in chat interface [done]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Implement a streaming response mechanism in the chat UI to display LLM responses as they are generated
### Details:
Build a streaming response component that: 1) Connects to the API service's streaming response capability, 2) Displays incremental text updates in the chat interface, 3) Shows typing indicators during generation, 4) Handles interruption of streaming responses, 5) Properly formats code blocks and special content in streamed responses, 6) Implements error recovery if streaming is interrupted, 7) Provides visual feedback on completion status. Use React with appropriate state management for handling streaming data.
