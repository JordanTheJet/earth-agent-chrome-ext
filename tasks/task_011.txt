# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Agent System with Vercel AI SDK for Multi-Step Tool Execution
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop an agent system using Vercel AI SDK that can execute Earth Engine operations through a sequence of tools (generate code → insert code → run code), enabling complex multi-step workflows.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive agent framework using Vercel AI SDK that orchestrates multi-step tool execution for Earth Engine operations. The implementation should include:

1. **Agent Framework Setup**:
   - Configure the Vercel AI SDK for agent-based execution
   - Implement the sequential execution pattern for the three primary operations: code generation, code insertion, and code execution
   - Create a state management system to track progress across steps

2. **Tool Schema Definition**:
   - Define JSON schemas for each Earth Engine operation tool
   - Create type definitions for tool inputs and outputs
   - Implement validation logic for tool parameters

3. **Agent Configuration**:
   - Set up agent initialization with appropriate model settings
   - Configure tool routing and selection logic
   - Implement context management to maintain conversation history

4. **Tool Handlers**:
   - Create handlers for each tool that interface with the Earth Engine API
   - Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Build logging functionality to track tool execution

5. **Execution Patterns**:
   - Implement chaining of tools for complex workflows
   - Create mechanisms for conditional tool execution based on previous results
   - Build parallel execution capabilities where appropriate

6. **Server-side Options Evaluation**:
   - Research and document the feasibility of using Mastra vs. Langchain for future implementation
   - Create a comparison matrix of features, performance, and integration complexity

The implementation should be modular to allow for future expansion of tool capabilities and should integrate seamlessly with the existing LLM API, GEE Code Editor, code generation, and console monitoring functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify the agent system's ability to correctly execute multi-step Earth Engine operations:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test each tool handler in isolation with mock inputs and outputs
   - Verify schema validation correctly identifies valid and invalid inputs
   - Test state management across multiple steps

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Create test scenarios that execute the full generate → insert → run sequence
   - Verify that the agent correctly maintains context between steps
   - Test error handling by introducing failures at different stages

3. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Implement test cases for common Earth Engine operations (e.g., image loading, filtering, visualization)
   - Verify that complex multi-step workflows complete successfully
   - Test performance under various load conditions

4. **Specific Test Cases**:
   - Simple image loading and display
   - Time-series analysis requiring multiple code generation and execution steps
   - Complex spatial analysis with conditional logic
   - Recovery from invalid code generation
   - Handling of Earth Engine API errors

5. **User Experience Testing**:
   - Verify that the agent provides clear feedback during execution
   - Test that error messages are helpful and actionable
   - Measure and optimize response times for each step

All tests should be automated where possible and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
