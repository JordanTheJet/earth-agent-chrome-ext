# Title: Implement Basic Chat Interface
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a functional chat UI in the side panel with message history display and input capabilities.
# Details:
Develop a responsive chat interface within the side panel that includes: 1) Message input field with send button, 2) Message display area with user and agent messages clearly distinguished, 3) Basic styling that doesn't obstruct the GEE workspace, 4) Local storage integration to persist chat history using Chrome Storage API, 5) Simple message handling system to display user inputs and static responses initially.

# Test Strategy:
Test the chat interface by sending messages and verifying they appear in the chat history. Verify that chat history persists across page reloads using Chrome Storage API. Ensure the UI is responsive and doesn't interfere with the GEE editor.
