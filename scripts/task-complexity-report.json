      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Chrome Extension Framework setup into specific implementation subtasks, focusing on manifest.json configuration, background script implementation, content script development, side panel UI creation, and permission/security setup.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves setting up multiple components of a Chrome extension with Manifest V3 compliance. While the structure is well-defined, it requires understanding of Chrome extension architecture, permissions model, and security policies. The task has clear deliverables but requires technical expertise across several extension components."
