## What Works

### Core Extension & Architecture
- âœ… Manifest V3 structure and permissions.
- âœ… Background service worker initialization.
- âœ… Content script injection and basic interaction with GEE page.
- âœ… Side panel UI rendering.
- âœ… Robust message passing between UI, Background (index.ts listener), and Content Script using `runtime.sendMessage` and `tabs.sendMessage`.
- âœ… Centralized helper (`sendMessageToEarthEngineTab`) in background for reliable content script communication (tab finding, ping/reload).
- âœ… Content script readiness tracking (`CONTENT_SCRIPT_LOADED`, `HEARTBEAT`).
- âœ… Fix for "Extension context invalidated" error in content script by checking `chrome.runtime.lastError`.

### UI Components
- âœ… Basic chat interface with message display (User/Assistant).
- âœ… Input submission.
- âœ… Session-based chat history.
- âœ… Streaming text rendering.
- âœ… **Agent Testing Panel**: Comprehensive testing interface with multi-tab design (Setup, Prompts, Run Tests, Results).
- âœ… **UI Component Library**: Complete set of shadcn/ui components (`label.tsx`, `select.tsx`, `switch.tsx`, `badge.tsx`, `progress.tsx`, `tabs.tsx`).
- âœ… Flask icon integration for easy access to testing panel.

### AI Integration (`chat-handler.ts`)
- âœ… Vercel AI SDK integration for chat completion.
- âœ… API key/provider configuration via storage.
- âœ… Streaming response handling.
- âœ… Basic system prompt (`GEE_SYSTEM_PROMPT`).
- âœ… Tool definition framework using `tool()`.
- âœ… Multi-modal response support for Anthropic models via `experimental_toToolResultContent`.
- âœ… **Helicone Integration**: Proxy-based observability with request tracking and analytics.

### Agent Testing Framework
- âœ… **Multi-Provider Support**: OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-o3) and Anthropic (Claude 4, Claude 3.7).
- âœ… **Test Configuration**: Configurable intervals, provider/model selection, session management.
- âœ… **Prompt Management**: Multi-line input, file upload (JSON/CSV/TXT), sample prompts.
- âœ… **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar, remaining test counter, success rate calculation.
- âœ… **Results Management**: Detailed test results, CSV export with metadata, screenshot integration.
- âœ… **State Management**: Fixed React closure issues with useRef pattern for reliable test execution.
- âœ… **Debugging Tools**: Connection testing, comprehensive console logging, error handling.

### Implemented Tools
- âœ… **Weather Tool**: Basic simulation.
- âœ… **Context7 Dataset Tool**: Fetches EE dataset docs via Context7 API.
- âœ… **Earth Engine Script Tool (`earthEngineScriptTool`)**: AI can insert code into the EE editor via background->content script messaging.
- âœ… **Earth Engine Run Code Tool (`earthEngineRunCodeTool`)**: AI can execute code in the EE environment via background->content script messaging.
- âœ… **Screenshot Tool**: Captures the current browser tab and displays the image directly in the chat (multi-modal response).
- âœ… **Browser Tools (General):**
  - âœ… `click.ts`: 
    - `clickByRef` (original ref-based click).
    - `clickByCoordinates` (newly added, uses `document.elementFromPoint`).
  - âœ… `getElement.ts`:
    - `getElement` (original selector-based).
    - `getElementByRefId` (newly added, with recursive shadow DOM traversal).
  - âœ… `typeText.ts`: Functional via background->content script messaging.
  - âœ… `snapshot.ts`: Functional via background->content script messaging.
  - âœ… `hover.ts`: Functional, exports types correctly.
  - âœ… All browser tools correctly exported via `src/lib/tools/browser/index.ts`.
  - âœ… Background script (`src/background/index.ts`) correctly handles message types for all browser tools.
  - âœ… Content script (`src/content/index.ts`) has handlers for all browser tool actions.

### Recent Major Fixes & Implementations
- âœ… **Agent Testing Panel**: Complete implementation with debugging and state management fixes.
- âœ… **Helicone Integration**: Proper AI SDK proxy-based implementation with request tracking.
- âœ… **State Management**: Fixed React closure issues that were preventing test execution.
- âœ… **UI Components**: Created missing shadcn/ui components for consistent design system.
- âœ… **Port-based Messaging**: Reliable communication pattern for agent testing workflow.
