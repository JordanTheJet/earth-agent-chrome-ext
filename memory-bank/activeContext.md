# Active Context: Google Earth Engine Agent

## Current Work Focus

We are currently in **Phase 1: MVP Foundation** of the Google Earth Engine Agent development.

The primary focus areas recently have been:

1.  **API Layer Refactoring & Consolidation**
    - Unifying the chat API backend logic (`src/api/chat.ts`, `src/background/routes.ts`, `src/background/index.ts`).
    - Establishing the Vercel AI SDK as the primary interaction method, with direct API calls as a fallback.
    - Centralizing configuration (API keys, providers, models).
    - Removing redundant code and improving type safety.

2.  **Chat UI Functionality & Bug Fixing**
    - Ensuring correct display of user messages (`src/components/Chat.tsx`).
    - Implementing conversation history persistence within a session.
    - Fixing streaming UI issues (blinking text, duplicate messages).
    - Refining streaming chunk handling for smooth text rendering.

3.  **Background Script Enhancement**
    - Updating message handlers (`handleChatMessage`) to process full conversation history.
    - Improving stream processing logic.

4.  **Agent System Implementation**
    - Exploring Vercel AI SDK agent capabilities for multi-step tool execution
    - Designing a system for sequential tool execution (generate code → insert code → run code)
    - Evaluating server-side approaches (Mastra, Langchain) vs. client-side AI SDK implementation

## Current Focus (Updated August 5, 2024)

We are building a Google Earth Engine Agent Chrome Extension that helps users work with Earth Engine for geospatial analysis.

   - Removed API key references from UI component message payloads
   - Added architecture documentation
   - Deleted obsolete files (`src/app/api/chat/route.ts`, `src/hooks/useExtensionChat.ts`, `src/api/chat.ts`, `src/background/routes.ts`)

2. **Tool Implementation Improvements**:
   - Added comprehensive Earth Engine dataset documentation tool in `chat-handler.ts`
   - Configured the tool to use Context7 for retrieving dataset information
