   - Missing type definitions for certain Chrome extension APIs

2. **GEE DOM Interaction**
   - Need deeper understanding of Google Earth Engine DOM structure
   - Finding reliable selectors for code editor and console
   - Implementing robust interaction with editor elements
   - Capturing console output reliably

3. **Extension Asset Management**
   - Optimizing asset loading and bundling
   - Creating proper icon sets and imagery
   - Reducing bundle size for better performance

4. **Tool Integration**
   - Implementing specialized tools for GEE operations
   - Creating consistent tool interfaces
   - Structuring tool calls for AI consumption

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 1-2 Days)
1. Fix TypeScript type definition issues in background script
2. Complete the messaging system implementation with error handling
3. Add settings storage for user preferences
4. Research and document GEE DOM structure
5. Begin implementation of core GEE tools

### Short-term (Next 1-2 Weeks)
1. Complete Vercel AI SDK integration for assistant functionality
2. Implement robust DOM interaction with GEE editor
3. Add code insertion and execution capabilities
4. Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. Enhance UI with loading states and better responsiveness

### Medium-term (Next Month)
1. Implement complete tool suite for GEE data analysis
2. Add streaming responses from AI
3. Create dataset search functionality
4. Implement advanced prompt engineering for GEE context
5. Enhance agent capabilities with tool usage

## Open Questions

1. **Performance Considerations**
   - What are the memory usage limits we should target?
   - How can we optimize the message passing system for minimal latency?
   - Should we implement lazy loading for certain components?

2. **DOM Interaction Stability**
   - How stable is the GEE DOM structure? Will our selectors break on updates?
   - What fallback mechanisms should we implement for DOM changes?
   - How can we make our DOM interaction more robust?

3. **User Experience Design**
   - What's the optimal UI layout for combining chat and tools?
   - How should we handle long-running operations visually?
   - What error states need special UI treatment?

4. **Tool Integration**
   - Which GEE tools should be prioritized for the first release?
   - How complex should the tool interfaces be?
   - What's the best way to implement tool selection and execution?

5. **Roadmap Prioritization**
   - Which roadmap items should be prioritized for the next development phase?
   - How should we integrate RAG for Google Earth Engine API?
   - When should we begin work on the MCP server for GEE integration?

## Recent Learnings

1. **Chrome Extension Patterns**
   - The Side Panel API provides a better UX than popups for persistent tools
   - Background service workers have different lifecycle considerations than background pages
   - Content scripts need special handling for page refreshes and navigation

2. **GEE Interface**
   - The Code Editor has a complex DOM structure with multiple nested iframes
   - Console output is rendered in a specific element with unique structure
   - The map interface has programmable components that can be targeted

3. **Agent Implementation**
   - Local models are not practical for extension deployment
   - API-based approach requires careful management of keys and security
   - Tool use requires structured prompt engineering
   - Vercel AI SDK provides useful abstractions for agent development

4. **Project Structure**
   - Task Master AI can help manage development tasks and subtasks
   - Well-structured memory bank improves development continuity
   - Clear architecture documentation speeds up implementation

## Decision Log

1. **Side Panel vs Popup** (2023-04-15)
   - **Decision:** Use Chrome Side Panel API instead of popup
   - **Rationale:** Provides persistent interface without taking space away from the GEE editor
   - **Trade-offs:** Limited to newer Chrome versions, more complex to implement

2. **TypeScript Implementation** (2023-04-16)
   - **Decision:** Implement using TypeScript instead of JavaScript
   - **Rationale:** Better type safety, easier maintenance, better IDE support
   - **Trade-offs:** More complex build process, additional learning curve

3. **Vercel AI SDK** (2023-04-18)
   - **Decision:** Use Vercel AI SDK for AI integration
   - **Rationale:** Built-in streaming, better handling of response formats, community support
   - **Trade-offs:** Adds dependency, may have limitations for complex tool use

4. **Client-side Only Architecture** (2023-04-20)
   - **Decision:** Implement as client-side only extension without backend
   - **Rationale:** Simpler deployment, better privacy, no backend costs
   - **Trade-offs:** Limited by client resources, requires careful API key management

5. **Multiple AI Provider Support** (2023-04-25)
   - **Decision:** Support multiple AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI)
   - **Rationale:** Provides flexibility, allows user choice, mitigates provider-specific limitations
   - **Trade-offs:** More complex implementation, additional testing requirements
