   - Error handling needs careful consideration

2. **Browser Automation**
   - Coordinate-based clicking requires careful implementation
   - Input element handling needs type-specific approach
   - DOM traversal requires efficient algorithms

3. **Tool Implementation**
   - Clear error messages improve debugging
   - Consistent response formats aid integration
   - Proper type checking enhances reliability

## Decision Log

1. **Snapshot Depth Configuration** (2024-03-20)
   - **Decision:** Add configurable depth for accessibility tree
   - **Rationale:** Provides flexibility for different use cases
   - **Trade-offs:** More complex implementation, needs careful serialization

2. **Click Coordinates** (2024-03-19)
   - **Decision:** Add support for clicking at specific coordinates
   - **Rationale:** More precise control over click actions
   - **Trade-offs:** Additional complexity in click handling

3. **Type Implementation** (2024-03-18)
   - **Decision:** Remove append parameter, focus on replacement
   - **Rationale:** Simplify implementation, match common use cases
   - **Trade-offs:** Less flexibility but clearer behavior

4. **Chrome API Migration** (2024-03-17)
   - **Decision:** Move to chrome.scripting.executeScript
   - **Rationale:** Better security, future compatibility
   - **Trade-offs:** More complex implementation, needs careful error handling
