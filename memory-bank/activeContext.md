# Active Context: Google Earth Engine Agent

## Current Work Focus (Updated December 17, 2024)

Building the Google Earth Engine Agent Chrome Extension. The primary focus areas recently have been:

1. **Agent Testing Panel Implementation and Debugging:**
   - Successfully implemented comprehensive `AgentTestPanel.tsx` with multi-tab interface for testing AI agent responses
   - Added support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-o3; Anthropic Claude 4, Claude 3.7)
   - Integrated Helicone observability using AI SDK proxy-based approach
   - Fixed critical state management bug in test execution that was preventing tests from running
   - Added comprehensive debugging and error handling for test execution flow

2. **Test Panel Features:**
   - Multi-line prompt input with file upload support (JSON/CSV/TXT)
   - Configurable test intervals and AI provider selection
   - Real-time progress tracking with remaining test counter and success rate
   - Screenshot capture integration with unique test IDs
   - Results export to CSV with detailed metadata
   - Helicone integration for request logging and analytics
   - GEE environment controls with configurable reset/clear functions and optional editor reload

3. **Robust Message Handling & State Management:**
   - Fixed React state closure issues in test execution loop using useRef pattern
   - Implemented proper port-based messaging for reliable communication with background script
   - Added comprehensive console logging for debugging test execution flow
   - Created "Test Connection" button for debugging messaging system

## Recent Changes

### Completed
- **Agent Testing Panel:**
  - Created comprehensive `AgentTestPanel.tsx` with three-tab interface (Setup, Prompts, Run Tests, Results)
  - Added Flask icon button to main chat UI for easy access
  - Implemented file upload support for test prompts (JSON/CSV/TXT with format examples)
  - Added AI provider selection with model options for OpenAI and Anthropic
  - Created configurable time intervals between tests
  - Implemented real-time progress tracking and success rate calculation
  - Added screenshot capture after each agent call with unique test IDs
  - Created CSV export functionality with detailed test metadata

- **Missing UI Components:**
  - Created `label.tsx`, `select.tsx`, `switch.tsx`, `badge.tsx`, `progress.tsx`, `tabs.tsx` components
  - All components follow shadcn/ui patterns and integrate with existing design system

- **Helicone Integration:**
  - Initially attempted @helicone/helpers package (corrected after user feedback)
  - Implemented proper AI SDK proxy-based Helicone integration
  - Added Helicone headers to chat messages for request tracking
  - Modified `chat-handler.ts` to accept heliconeHeaders and configure AI providers with proxy URLs
  - Updated background script to pass Helicone headers to chat handler

- **State Management Fix:**
  - Identified and fixed critical bug where tests were immediately stopping due to stale closure issue
  - Replaced DOM query approach with useRef pattern for tracking running state
  - Added proper ref updates in start/stop test functions
  - Implemented comprehensive debugging with console logging

- **Background Script Integration:**
  - Updated background script to handle "agent-test" port connections
  - Ensured proper message routing for test execution through existing chat handler
  - Maintained compatibility with existing chat functionality

- **GEE Environment Configuration:**
  - Added toggle for reloading Google Earth Engine editor between tests (disabled by default)
  - Implemented warning text explaining the trade-offs of editor reload functionality
  - Integrated configuration persistence with existing settings system

- **Environment Management Tools for Main Agent:**
  - Added `resetMapInspectorConsoleTool` to main agent for clearing GEE map, inspector, and console state
  - Added `clearScriptTool` to main agent for removing all code from GEE code editor
  - Updated system prompt with environment management workflow guidelines
  - Enabled users to request workspace cleanup through natural language interaction

### In Progress
- Testing agent test panel with actual AI responses to validate full workflow
- Verifying Helicone integration captures test requests properly
- Monitoring for any UI/UX improvements needed based on usage

## Current Challenges

- Ensuring test execution is reliable across different AI providers and network conditions
- Managing state properly during test execution to prevent interruptions
- Providing clear feedback when tests fail due to API issues vs. extension issues
- Optimizing test execution timing to avoid rate limits while maintaining reasonable test speeds

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 1-2 Days)
1. Validate agent testing panel works end-to-end with actual AI API responses
2. Test Helicone integration captures and logs test requests properly
3. Verify CSV export includes all expected metadata
4. Test file upload functionality with various prompt formats

### Short-term (Next Week)
1. Add more sophisticated test result analysis and reporting
2. Implement test templates for common agent testing scenarios
3. Add batch test execution capabilities
4. Create saved test configurations for repeated testing

## Open Questions

- What additional test metrics would be most valuable for agent performance evaluation?
- Should we add support for custom test assertions or validation rules?
- How can we best integrate test results with CI/CD workflows?

## Recent Learnings

- React state closures in async loops can cause immediate termination issues - useRef is essential for tracking mutable state
- AI SDK proxy-based approach for Helicone is much cleaner than package-based integration
- Port-based messaging provides more reliable communication than one-off runtime messages for testing scenarios
- Comprehensive debugging output is crucial for diagnosing issues in complex async workflows
- File upload functionality requires careful parsing and validation for different formats

## Decision Log

- **Agent Testing Panel Architecture** (2024-12-17)
  - **Decision:** Implement as modal overlay with tabbed interface integrated into main chat UI
  - **Rationale:** Provides comprehensive testing capabilities while maintaining easy access from main interface
  - **Implementation:** Flask icon button opens modal with Setup, Prompts, Run Tests, and Results tabs

- **Helicone Integration Method** (2024-12-17)
  - **Decision:** Use AI SDK proxy-based approach instead of @helicone/helpers package
  - **Rationale:** More aligned with AI SDK architecture, cleaner implementation, no additional dependencies
  - **Implementation:** Configure AI providers with proxy URLs and add headers to chat messages

- **Test State Management** (2024-12-17)
  - **Decision:** Use useRef for tracking running state instead of DOM queries
  - **Rationale:** Prevents React state closure issues that were causing tests to immediately stop
  - **Implementation:** isRunningRef tracks state synchronously, updated alongside React state

- **Test Communication Pattern** (2024-12-17)
  - **Decision:** Use port-based messaging for test execution instead of direct API calls
  - **Rationale:** Leverages existing chat infrastructure, ensures consistent behavior, maintains extension permissions model
  - **Implementation:** Tests send messages through same port system used by main chat interface
