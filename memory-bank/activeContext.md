### In Progress
- Testing Qwen integration with actual API responses to validate full workflow
- Verifying Helicone integration captures Qwen test requests properly (if supported)
- Monitoring for any UI/UX improvements needed based on Qwen usage

## Current Challenges

- Ensuring test execution is reliable across all four AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, **Qwen**) and different network conditions
- Managing state properly during test execution to prevent interruptions across all providers
- Providing clear feedback when tests fail due to API issues vs. extension issues
- Optimizing test execution timing to avoid rate limits while maintaining reasonable test speeds
- Verifying Helicone observability works with Qwen provider (may need special configuration)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 1-2 Days)
1. **✅ COMPLETED:** Qwen agent integration works end-to-end with actual DashScope API responses
2. Test Helicone integration captures and logs Qwen requests properly (if supported)
3. Verify CSV export includes all expected metadata for Qwen tests
4. Test file upload functionality with various prompt formats for Qwen testing

### Short-term (Next Week)
1. Add more sophisticated test result analysis and reporting across all providers
2. Implement test templates for common agent testing scenarios including Qwen-specific tests
3. Add batch test execution capabilities for multi-provider testing
4. Create saved test configurations for repeated testing across providers

## Open Questions

- Does Helicone support Qwen provider observability or does it need special configuration?
- What additional test metrics would be most valuable for comparing performance across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and **Qwen**?
- Should we add support for custom test assertions or validation rules specific to each provider?
- How can we best integrate test results with CI/CD workflows for multi-provider testing?

## Recent Learnings

- **✅ Qwen Integration Success:** Qwen AI SDK integration follows similar patterns to other providers but requires the correct base URL for DashScope
- **✅ DashScope API Keys:** Don't follow the same format as Google keys (no specific prefix validation needed)
- **✅ AI SDK Community Provider:** The AI SDK community provider for Qwen works seamlessly with the existing architecture
- **✅ Git Workflow:** Successfully committed comprehensive changes with proper commit message structure
- **✅ Build Process:** All Qwen changes compile successfully and maintain compatibility
- React state closures in async loops can cause immediate termination issues - useRef is essential for tracking mutable state
- AI SDK proxy-based approach for Helicone is much cleaner than package-based integration
- Port-based messaging provides more reliable communication than one-off runtime messages for testing scenarios
- Comprehensive debugging output is crucial for diagnosing issues in complex async workflows
- File upload functionality requires careful parsing and validation for different formats

## Decision Log

- **✅ Qwen Provider Integration** (2024-12-17) - **COMPLETED & COMMITTED**
  - **Decision:** Use `qwen-ai-provider` community package with AI SDK rather than implementing custom OpenAI-compatible solution
  - **Rationale:** Leverages existing AI SDK architecture, provides proper type safety, and maintains consistency with other providers
  - **Implementation:** Added as fourth provider option with full feature parity to existing providers
  - **Status:** ✅ Successfully implemented, tested, and committed to git

- **✅ Qwen Base URL Configuration** (2024-12-17) - **COMPLETED & COMMITTED**
  - **Decision:** Use https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1 as the base URL for Qwen
  - **Rationale:** This is the official OpenAI-compatible endpoint for DashScope API as documented
  - **Implementation:** Set in qwen provider configuration in chat-handler.ts
  - **Status:** ✅ Successfully implemented and verified in build

- **✅ Qwen API Key Validation** (2024-12-17) - **COMPLETED & COMMITTED**
  - **Decision:** Use simple non-empty validation rather than format-specific validation like Google
  - **Rationale:** DashScope API keys don't have a standardized prefix format, so basic presence check is sufficient
  - **Implementation:** Simple trim() and length check in chat-handler.ts
  - **Status:** ✅ Successfully implemented and working

- **Agent Testing Panel Architecture** (2024-12-17)
  - **Decision:** Implement as modal overlay with tabbed interface integrated into main chat UI
  - **Rationale:** Provides comprehensive testing capabilities while maintaining easy access from main interface
  - **Implementation:** Flask icon button opens modal with Setup, Prompts, Run Tests, and Results tabs

- **Helicone Integration Method** (2024-12-17)
  - **Decision:** Use AI SDK proxy-based approach instead of @helicone/helpers package
  - **Rationale:** More aligned with AI SDK architecture, cleaner implementation, no additional dependencies
  - **Implementation:** Configure AI providers with proxy URLs and add headers to chat messages

- **Test State Management** (2024-12-17)
  - **Decision:** Use useRef for tracking running state instead of DOM queries
  - **Rationale:** Prevents React state closure issues that were causing tests to immediately stop
  - **Implementation:** isRunningRef tracks state synchronously, updated alongside React state

- **Test Communication Pattern** (2024-12-17)
  - **Decision:** Use port-based messaging for test execution instead of direct API calls
  - **Rationale:** Leverages existing chat infrastructure, ensures consistent behavior, maintains extension permissions model
  - **Implementation:** Tests send messages through same port system used by main chat interface
