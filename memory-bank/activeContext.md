# Active Context: Google Earth Engine Agent

## Current Work Focus

We are currently in **Phase 1: MVP Foundation** of the Google Earth Engine Agent development.

The primary focus areas recently have been:

1.  **API Layer Refactoring & Consolidation**
    - Unifying the chat API backend logic (`src/api/chat.ts`, `src/background/routes.ts`, `src/background/index.ts`).
    - Establishing the Vercel AI SDK as the primary interaction method, with direct API calls as a fallback.
    - Centralizing configuration (API keys, providers, models).
    - Removing redundant code and improving type safety.
    - Adding comprehensive model selection for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google/Gemini.
    - Implementing provider-specific API key storage for better UX when switching between providers.
    - Adding detailed console logging for model usage and chat interactions.

2.  **Chat UI Functionality & Bug Fixing**
    - Ensuring correct display of user messages (`src/components/Chat.tsx`).
    - Implementing conversation history persistence within a session.
    - Fixing streaming UI issues (blinking text, duplicate messages).
    - Refining streaming chunk handling for smooth text rendering.
    - Adding UI components for provider and model selection.

3.  **Background Script Enhancement**
    - Updating message handlers (`handleChatMessage`) to process full conversation history.
    - Improving stream processing logic.

4.  **Agent System Implementation**
    - Exploring Vercel AI SDK agent capabilities for multi-step tool execution
    - Designing a system for sequential tool execution (generate code → insert code → run code)
    - Evaluating server-side approaches (Mastra, Langchain) vs. client-side AI SDK implementation
