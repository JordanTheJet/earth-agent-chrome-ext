# Active Context: Google Earth Engine Agent

## Current Work Focus

We are currently in **Phase 1: MVP Foundation** of the Google Earth Engine Agent development.

The primary focus areas recently have been:

1.  **API Layer Refactoring & Consolidation**
    - Unifying the chat API backend logic (`src/api/chat.ts`, `src/background/routes.ts`, `src/background/index.ts`).
    - Establishing the Vercel AI SDK as the primary interaction method, with direct API calls as a fallback.
    - Centralizing configuration (API keys, providers, models).
    - Removing redundant code and improving type safety.

2.  **Chat UI Functionality & Bug Fixing**
    - Ensuring correct display of user messages (`src/components/Chat.tsx`).
    - Implementing conversation history persistence within a session.
    - Fixing streaming UI issues (blinking text, duplicate messages).
    - Refining streaming chunk handling for smooth text rendering.

3.  **Background Script Enhancement**
    - Updating message handlers (`handleChatMessage`) to process full conversation history.
    - Improving stream processing logic.

## Recent Changes

### Completed
- **API Consolidation:**
  - Refactored chat API logic into `src/api/chat.ts` and relevant background handlers.
  - Removed `src/api/chat-route.ts`.
  - Standardized API interaction using Vercel AI SDK first, then direct calls.
  - Added support for configurable models via storage/env vars.
- **Chat UI Fixes:**
  - Corrected CSS for user message display.
  - Implemented session-based conversation history.
  - Fixed streaming UI bugs (blinking text, duplicate messages) by refining state management and background stream handling.
- **Background Script Updates:**
  - `handleChatMessage` now processes the full message history.
  - Improved stream processing logic in background script.
- Enhanced click functionality
  - Added support for clicking at specific coordinates
  - Improved element finding logic
  - Enhanced error handling and messaging

- Improved type functionality
  - Removed deprecated append parameter
  - Enhanced support for different input types
  - Improved error handling for missing elements

- Enhanced snapshot tool
  - Added configurable depth for accessibility tree
  - Improved serialization handling
  - Enhanced error reporting

- Updated background script
  - Migrated to chrome.scripting.executeScript
  - Improved error handling
  - Enhanced message passing
  - Added support for new tool features

### In Progress
- Testing new browser tool implementations
- Refining error handling in background script
- Improving Tools Test Panel interface
- Documenting new tool capabilities

## Current Challenges

1. **Chrome API Migration**
   - Ensuring compatibility with Manifest V3
   - Handling serialization issues
   - Managing script execution contexts

2. **Error Handling**
   - Providing meaningful error messages
   - Handling edge cases gracefully
   - Maintaining consistent error formats

3. **Tool Integration**
   - Ensuring reliable tool execution
   - Managing tool state and feedback
   - Handling tool-specific requirements

4. **UI Feedback**
   - Providing clear success/error states
   - Maintaining responsive interface
   - Handling long-running operations

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 1-2 Days)
1. Complete testing of updated browser tools
2. Finalize error handling improvements
3. Update documentation for new features
4. Implement any necessary UI refinements

### Short-term (Next 1-2 Weeks)
1. Add more browser automation capabilities
2. Enhance tool testing interface
3. Improve error recovery mechanisms
4. Add more user feedback features

### Medium-term (Next Month)
1. Implement advanced browser automation features
2. Add more sophisticated error handling
3. Enhance tool coordination capabilities
4. Improve overall system reliability

## Open Questions

1. **Tool Enhancement**
   - What additional browser automation features are needed?
   - How can we improve tool reliability?
   - What new capabilities should we add?

2. **Error Handling**
   - How can we make error messages more helpful?
   - What additional error cases should we handle?
   - How can we improve error recovery?

3. **User Experience**
   - How can we improve tool feedback?
   - What additional UI features are needed?
   - How can we make tools more intuitive?

## Recent Learnings

1. **Chrome Extension Development**
   - Chrome's scripting API provides better security and reliability
   - Proper serialization is crucial for message passing
   - Error handling needs careful consideration

2. **Browser Automation**
   - Coordinate-based clicking requires careful implementation
   - Input element handling needs type-specific approach
   - DOM traversal requires efficient algorithms

3. **Tool Implementation**
   - Clear error messages improve debugging
   - Consistent response formats aid integration
   - Proper type checking enhances reliability

## Decision Log

1. **Snapshot Depth Configuration** (2024-03-20)
   - **Decision:** Add configurable depth for accessibility tree
   - **Rationale:** Provides flexibility for different use cases
   - **Trade-offs:** More complex implementation, needs careful serialization

2. **Click Coordinates** (2024-03-19)
   - **Decision:** Add support for clicking at specific coordinates
   - **Rationale:** More precise control over click actions
   - **Trade-offs:** Additional complexity in click handling

3. **Type Implementation** (2024-03-18)
   - **Decision:** Remove append parameter, focus on replacement
   - **Rationale:** Simplify implementation, match common use cases
   - **Trade-offs:** Less flexibility but clearer behavior

4. **Chrome API Migration** (2024-03-17)
   - **Decision:** Move to chrome.scripting.executeScript
   - **Rationale:** Better security, future compatibility
   - **Trade-offs:** More complex implementation, needs careful error handling
