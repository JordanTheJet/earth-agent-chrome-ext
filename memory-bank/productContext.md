# Product Context: Google Earth Engine Agent

## Problem Space

### Challenges with Google Earth Engine

Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a powerful cloud platform for planetary-scale geospatial analysis that has revolutionized how scientists and researchers work with satellite imagery and geospatial data. However, it presents several significant challenges for users:

1. **Steep Learning Curve**: GEE combines JavaScript/Python programming with specialized Earth observation concepts, creating a significant barrier for new users.

2. **Complex API**: The Earth Engine API includes thousands of functions, datasets, and methods that can be overwhelming to navigate and master.

3. **Domain-Specific Knowledge**: Effective use requires understanding of both programming and geospatial concepts like remote sensing, band combinations, and spectral indices.

4. **Dataset Discovery Challenges**: With petabytes of data available, finding the right dataset for a specific analysis can be difficult.

5. **Code Debugging Complexity**: Errors in Earth Engine code can be cryptic and difficult to troubleshoot, especially for those new to the platform.

6. **Workflow Optimization**: Determining the most efficient approach to solve geospatial problems often requires advanced knowledge.

### Market Gap

While there are learning resources for GEE (documentation, tutorials, forums), there's a lack of:

1. **Contextual Assistance**: Real-time help that understands what the user is currently working on.

2. **Personalized Guidance**: Support that adapts to the user's knowledge level and specific needs.

3. **Natural Language Interface**: The ability to express geospatial analysis goals in plain language.

4. **Integrated Experience**: Assistance that works directly within the Earth Engine interface without context switching.

## Product Principles

### Education Over Automation

While the agent automates certain tasks, its primary goal is to educate users and build their capabilities:
- Explanations accompany generated code
- Concepts are introduced progressively
- Users are guided toward self-sufficiency

### Context Sensitivity

The agent's effectiveness comes from understanding the user's current context:
- Awareness of code in the editor
- Recognition of visualized data and map state
- Understanding of recent errors or outputs
- Knowledge of the user's skill level and goals

### User Control

Users should always remain in control of their Earth Engine experience:
- All suggestions are optional
- Agent actions require explicit user approval
- Privacy preferences are respected
- Context sharing is transparent

### Progressive Disclosure

Information is presented in layers of increasing detail:
- Initial responses focus on core solutions
- Additional details are available on request
- Advanced concepts are introduced when appropriate
- Help adapts to the user's demonstrated knowledge
