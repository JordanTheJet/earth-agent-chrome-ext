# Project Brief: Google Earth Engine Agent

## Project Overview

The Google Earth Engine Agent is an AI-powered extension for Google Earth Engine (GEE) that provides contextual assistance, code help, and knowledge support to users working with Earth Engine's geospatial platform. It serves as a bridge between Earth Engine's powerful capabilities and users of varying expertise levels.

## Project Goals

1. **Democratize Access to Earth Engine**: Lower the barrier to entry for non-experts by providing contextually relevant assistance.

2. **Accelerate Development**: Reduce development time by offering code suggestions, dataset recommendations, and troubleshooting help.

3. **Enhance Knowledge**: Facilitate learning about Earth Engine, remote sensing, and geospatial analysis through interactive assistance.

4. **Streamline Workflows**: Help users discover optimal approaches to geospatial problems by suggesting efficient techniques and best practices.

## Target Users

1. **Earth Scientists**: Researchers who understand the science but may struggle with Earth Engine's programming model.

2. **GIS Specialists**: Professionals transitioning from traditional GIS to cloud-based Earth Engine.

3. **Students & Educators**: Those learning or teaching Earth Engine, remote sensing, and geospatial analysis.

4. **Developers**: Software engineers or data scientists using Earth Engine for specific projects.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Contextual Awareness

The agent must understand:
- Current code in the editor

- Side panel for extended conversations and assistance
- Contextual tooltips for quick information
- Non-intrusive design that enhances rather than distracts

### 4. Knowledge Base

- Comprehensive understanding of Earth Engine API
- Awareness of common geospatial analysis techniques
- Knowledge of remote sensing principles
- Familiarity with Earth Engine datasets and their applications
- Understanding of typical workflows and use cases

### 5. Privacy & Security

- Local processing where possible
- Transparent handling of user data
- Secure API key management
- Clear permissions model
- User control over shared context

## Success Metrics

1. **User Productivity**: Measured reduction in time to complete common Earth Engine tasks
